## Sticking with Twitter

Is data scraping ethical?
Is not studying social networks less ethical?

EU law forcing Twitter to share data

...

Or Reddit (live threads or /r/all)

But should we stick with one social network?
Even Reddit is restricting API access

## The fediverse

- aggregating content from multiple social networks
- focusing on communities with specific themes

But also:

- smaller networks
- new forms of noise
- different formats we're not used toâ€”do we have to start from scratch?
- new cultures: the ethics of sharing datasets (deleted toots) and how social networks feel about being studied

## A new role for science
