Academic writing is a craft.
Like all crafts, it requires practice, but it can also be learned.
Unfortunately, resources to learn academic writing are somewhat scattered.
In this blog post, I lost some of my suggested resources, including books and blogs, tools to help you write better, and other resources to improve your visualizations.

> Accompanying this post is [The Big List of Academic Writing Tips]({{< ref "/posts/big-list-academic-writing-tips" >}} "The Big List of Academic Writing Tips").
