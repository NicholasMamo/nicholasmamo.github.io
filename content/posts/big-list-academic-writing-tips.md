- **TODO: use a parallel structure: a rule in bold followed by a longer a description and an example**

- Why good writing is important
	- Advantage in peer-review
	- Can show your personality
	- Easier to understand, and thus cite (Badanu example)

- A paper _can_ be formal and interesting; it's not function over form, nor form over function, but function with form
In fact, it's not even true that tradition says formal writing cannot be interesting:

> Differences in the content of the thing to be reproduced are of great influence.
> Melodies may become a source of torment by the undesired persistency of their return.
> Forms and colors are not so importunate; and if they do return, it is with noticeable loss of clearness and certainty.
> The musician writes for the orchestra what his inner voice sings to him; the painter rarely relies without disadvantage solely upon the images which his inner eye presents to him; nature gives him his forms, study governs his combinations of them.
> It is with something of a struggle that past states of feeling are realized; when realized, and this is often only through the instrumentality of the movements which accompanied them, they are but pale shadows of themselves.
> Emotionally true singing is rarer than technically correct singing
> â€” Ebbinghaus, 1913

- Tell the right story (you need something to write about), in the right way (the grammar), and in an interesting form.

## The story

- Sign-post to orient the reader.
Know what your readers expects of you in every part.
Not just the section, but also the arguments: first, second, third.
Parallelism as sign-posting.

- The introduction should make clear what problem you are trying to solve (problem definition), why it matters that you solve it (motivation), how others attempted to solve it (background) and how you will attempt to solve it (methodology), and your results (contributions).

- Follow a thread.
A thread is a common theme throughout a book, its chapters and sections.
Sections can have their own threads, but they must advance the chapter's thread; likewise, chapters can have their own threads, but they must advance the book's thread.
Structure your arguments around this thread, and every so often, refer back to the thread to remind the reader of what matters.
Helps you decide what story you want to tell, stick with it and keep  your readers' attention.

- Plan top down.
First, decide the thread of the whole book, which gives you its chapters.
Then decide, the thread of each chapter, which gives you its sections.
Finally, decide the thread of each section, which gives you its paragraph.

- Write while planning.

- For each paragraph, decide its purpose (what you will discuss) and the the conclusion.
Use the conclusion to link paragraphs together: build an argument gradually, always reflecting the thread.

- Visualizations are part of the narrative.
Remove everything that detracts from the story; highlight the lines, bars or other elements that help you tell the story and fade away the rest (such as the baselines), and don't be afraid to annotate with text.
Read Storytelling with data.

- Visualizations should be independent.
Write descriptive titles using declarative sentences that state what readers should conclude; otherwise, you give readers work they do not want to do, and risk them drawing the wrong conclusion.
Expand the title in a longer caption.

- Report significance, where possible (including template?).

## The grammar

- You can usually remove phrases like _for example_ and _for instance_ to improve the flow; the context usually makes it obvious that you are giving examples

- Know the rules so you can break them.
Rather, know why the rules exist so you know when you can get away with not following them.
Long sentences, synonyms.

## The form

- If you can't make it interesting, make it short.
Just because you spent a lot of time on it, it doesn't mean you need to write a lot about it.

- Give examples, not just from literature but also practical (if relevant).
My rule of thumb: one example every two paragraphs.
Rule of threes: three examples.

- Choose one example as an illustrative example.
Instead of describing a class of methods, describe one particularly-relevant example in depth and present it as an example of the broader class.
Use the illustrative example as part of the thread, always returning back to it.

- Make an impression, leave with a bang.
Spend extra time refining the introduction and conclusion; you can approach it as micro-writing.
This applies not only to your introduction and conclusion chapters, but also to the introduction and conclusion of each section.

- Choose the right words.
Few true synonyms.

- Simplify the text.

- Interesting bits at the beginning or the end.
Use them as connections.

- Know how to make an impact.
_But_ at the start of the sentence, single-sentence paragraphs, colons or em-dashes, or very short sentences.

- Figures (as in, numbers) to describe extent (and thus, impact).
Quick-fire figures in the text.

- Use passive verbs sparingly: when you don't know who did something.
Usually, using the passive tense is a sign you haven't figured out who is doing what.
If it's a general, argument, the subjects are the _researchers_ or _literature_.

- Reuse the same (specific or technical) words to link arguments.
Example from The Witcher?

- Read like a writer (link to book).
