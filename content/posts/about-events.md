Events have been a big part of my life since 2016.
My name is Nicholas Mamo and I'm a doctoral student at the University of Malta.
2016 is the year when I started working on my undergraduate dissertation and the subject was events.

More specifically, the research area I chose for my undergraduate dissertation was Topic Detection and Tracking: a subset of Artificial Intelligence that builds timelines for events.
That sounds simple, but it's not.

To generate a timeline like that one, Topic Detection and Tracking systems need to be able to, at least:

- detect when something happened,
- track it until it ends, and
- describe what happened.

That's not all.
Our way of programming machines to understand events is changing, which allows us create timelines that describe the event better.

A lot has changed since 2016; I graduated, obtained my Masters degree and started my doctorate, but the one thing that has remained constant is my research area: Topic Detection and Tracking.

Although my supervisors and I have made some great strides, the area of Topic Detection and Tracking remains fairly unknown.
This blog's purpose is to start changing that.

I want to use this blog to explain the basics of Topic Detection and Tracking, to describe the findings and challenges, and to give a glimpse of my researchâ€”all in plain English.
May you come to appreciate these kind of events as much as I do.
